# Chit-Chat

This is a simple instant messaging program that allows multiple clients to connect to a server and send messages to each other. It also supports file uploads, downloads, and listing of uploaded files.

## Usage

1. Start the server by running `python server.py` in a terminal.
2. Clients can connect to the server by running `python client.py` in another terminal.
3. Clients must enter a unique nickname when prompted.
4. Clients can send messages to the server by typing them into the terminal and pressing Enter.
5. To upload a file, a client can use the `/upload` command followed by the filename. The file must have one of the following extensions: `.txt`, `.pem`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.mp3`, or `.mp4`.
6. To download a file, a client can use the `/download` command followed by the filename.
7. To list all uploaded files, a client can use the `/list-files` command.

## Requirements
